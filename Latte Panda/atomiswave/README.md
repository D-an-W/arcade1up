# Configuration files for the Atomiswave system under RetroPie

Place the emulators.cfg, retroarch.cfg files with the Reicast folder (and contents) into the /opt/retropie/configs/atomiswave/ directory

Note: You'll have to create this dir

Take the contexts of the es_systems.cfg file and edit Emulation Stations es_systems.cfg located at /etc/emulationstation and add this to the file within the </systems> section

### Note: You will need to also use the IntelGFX config file for lr-reicast to display correctly.

ROMs should be placed in the Retropie roms older called atomiswave (you will need to create this).
